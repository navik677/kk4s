# Handoff — read this first in a new session

Last update: 2026-10-31 (end of session). Goal: **any Kirikiri (KAG/TJS2) game folder runs unmodified** on the
Switch (and on PC via the viewer). Game files are never changed; fixes live in the engine,
`compat/` or kk4s' own files. Full requirements: `docs/original-prompt.md`; milestones: `docs/roadmap.md`.

## Where we are (2026-11-01)

`main` has all work up to now (PR #1 "Switch fixes" merged). The SD card holds the latest build.

Works on the Switch (user-tested): launcher, exit to the launcher (engine threads stopped,
detached thread stacks closed), in-game menu on L3 + R3, saves outside the game folder, FSN PC
version (only `profiles/FSN/xp3filter.tjs` needed), loading saves, choices after a loaded save,
video playback (FFmpeg player). PC viewer is the test loop; `KK4S_INPUT_SCRIPT` drives games like
a Switch user (pad, touch, screenshots, `eval`) - see `docs/debugging.md`.

### Open problem the user is waiting on: audio clicks on the Switch
Clicking A while a voice line plays (skipping it) gives an audible "tap" on the Switch only.
- Fixed already (verified on PC with SDL's `disk` audio driver + sine analysis): per-chunk
  `SDL_AudioCVT` resampling (now one `SDL_AudioStream` per buffer), hard stop of a playing sound
  (now ~8 ms fade tail, also kept when the buffer is deleted: `AdoptTail`). The click remains.
- PC mixer output for "stop voice -> open next -> play" is clean, so the cause is on the device
  side: SDL's Switch driver (`SDL_switchaudio.c`) queues only ONE 4096-sample buffer (~85 ms)
  ahead; any late callback or empty stream = gap.
- The current build logs `audio: late callback ...` and `audio: stream ... ran dry ...`
  (`WaveMixer.cpp`). NEXT STEP: get a Switch log with clicks (user skips voices, exits to the
  launcher, fetch `logs/` over FTP) and fix what it shows. Ideas: if callbacks are late -> raise the
  audio thread priority / use more device buffers (own audren path or SDL hint); if streams run dry
  -> bigger L1 lead (`TVPAL_BUFFER_COUNT` 4 x 125 ms) or find the lock the feeder thread
  (`tTVPWaveSoundBufferThread`) waits on during the slow frames (300-900 ms) that follow a click.

### Other known issues
- Slow frames on page changes (Switch): 300-900 ms, almost all "other" (game scripts / layer ops
  in TJS). Not yet profiled further.
- "Text appears at once" in FSN = the game's own setting (already-read text speed = instant);
  unread text types normally. Not a bug.
- `.tpm` decryption not implemented: encrypted games need a Kirikiroid2 `xp3filter.tjs`
  (game folder or `<data>/profiles/<game>/`).
- Video: wall-clock sync (not audio clock); mixer mode drawn like overlay; not speed-checked for
  WMV/H.264 on the Switch.
- Quick-load hook trimming (`data900.kdt.kk4s`) is count-based (approximate).

### What was done in the 2026-10-31/11-01 sessions (details in `docs/status.md`)
Exit to launcher (libnx exit mode, engine shutdown, `TVPStopAllThreads`, `__syscall_thread_detach`
reaping, pausing leftovers), L3 + R3 menu, worker threads on cores 1-2, CPU boost setting, -O3
pixel loops, fonts in memory, 64 KB write buffer, slow-frame breakdown, old Kirikiri 2 compat
(exe options, `-evalcontext=global`, class vars keeping native properties), util.dll / fstat.dll,
profiles folder for helper scripts, quick-load hook trimming, KAG call-stack restore fix (choices
after loading), video player + anti-hang, audio resampling and fade-out, input scripts with `eval`.

## Dev setup (Linux, Fedora)

```bash
sudo dnf install SDL2-devel freetype-devel ffmpeg-free-devel libpng-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel \
  turbojpeg-devel libwebp-devel libogg-devel libvorbis-devel opus-devel opusfile-devel zlib-devel \
  oniguruma-devel libcurl-devel
bash tools/build-desktop.sh            # or ASAN=1; DEPS=1 installs deps with apt / pacman only
cmake --build build-desktop -j$(nproc) && cp build-desktop/kk4s out-desktop/   # incremental
KK4S_ROOT=/tmp/kk4s-run ./out-desktop/kk4s game/fsn    # one game; without an argument: launcher
```

Windows (no admin): portable MSYS2 (`msys2-base-x86_64-latest.sfx.exe`), `pacman -Syu` twice, then
`DEPS=1 bash tools/build-desktop.sh` in a UCRT64 shell. Details: `docs/pc-viewer.md`.

Switch builds come from CI (`gh run download <id>`); locally via Docker (`README.md`). On the
Fedora dev box there is only podman, which needs the full image name:
`sed 's#^FROM devkitpro/#FROM docker.io/devkitpro/#' Dockerfile > /tmp/Dockerfile && podman build -t kk4s-build -f /tmp/Dockerfile .`,
then `podman run --rm -v "$PWD":/src:Z kk4s-build bash tools/build-switch.sh` → `out/kk4s.nro`.

## Working with the user's Switch

The user runs an FTP server on the Switch (ftpd, port 5000, anonymous; ask for the IP):

```bash
curl -T out/kk4s.nro ftp://<switch-ip>:5000/switch/kk4s/kk4s.nro        # deploy
curl -s ftp://<switch-ip>:5000/switch/kk4s/logs/                         # list logs
curl -s ftp://<switch-ip>:5000/atmosphere/crash_reports/                 # crash reports
```

A log of a running game cannot be downloaded (the file is open) — ask the user to quit first. FTP
stops when the console sleeps. Big uploads: one file per `curl`, check sizes afterwards.

## Debugging toolbox

- **Log first** (`logs/kk4s-*.log`): script exceptions with TJS stack traces, `compat:` decisions,
  `fonts:`, `input:`, `launcher:`, `overlay:` lines, `slow frame: N ms (compose …, other …)` for frames over 200 ms (fields: `docs/debugging.md`).
- **Crash reports**: Atmosphere report + `kk4s.elf` of the same build (git hash in the log). Without
  devkitPro, `eu-addr2line -f -C -i -e kk4s.elf 0x<offset>` works on the aarch64 ELF; the report
  prints offsets as `kk4s + 0x...`. See `docs/debugging.md`.
- **Screenshots without screen capture** (KDE Wayland): `KK4S_LAUNCHER_SHOT`, `KK4S_OVERLAY_SHOT`,
  render probes with `Layer.saveLayerImage` — see `docs/launcher.md`. Keys can be sent with
  python-xlib to the XWayland window (`SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11`; find the window by WM_CLASS `kk4s`).
- **`SDL_RENDER_DRIVER=opengles2`** = the Switch's renderer.
- **`KK4S_SKIP=AfterInit2.tjs,Override2.tjs`** disables Kirikiroid helper scripts.
- **`tools/xp3ls`** lists XP3 contents (works on encrypted archives).
- **Probe technique** for reading decrypted game scripts: a scratch `startup.tjs` (UTF-16LE with BOM)
  that runs the game's `xp3filter.tjs`, loads a file from an archive and saves it elsewhere. Never
  commit game files.
- Profiling on PC: `eu-stack -p <pid>` in a loop (no perf on the dev box). The PC is much faster than
  the Switch; count expensive operations (file opens, texture creation) instead of timing them.

## Gotchas learned the hard way

- Many engine files use **CRLF**; edit them with Python preserving `\r\n` (or Edit), check with
  `file` and `git diff --stat`.
- TJS is not thread-safe: never run TJS off the main thread.
- KAG builds `<exe>/savedata/...` itself — engine-level path settings alone do not move saves.
- Test runs through symlinks still write into the real game folder (saves, `title.txt`): use copies
  or `KK4S_ROOT` + separate saves, and never write into the user's game folders.
- The Switch SD card is slow for many small writes / opens: log in batches, cache font faces.
- SDL's Switch controller mapping is positional (A/B swapped) — read libnx instead.
- `rm -rf` on variables is blocked by a safety check; use `"${VAR:?}"/...`.
- The user wants code reviewed before CI, not trial-and-error pushes.

## Next steps

1. Audio clicks on the Switch: read the diagnostics above from a fresh Switch log and fix.
2. Profile the 300-900 ms slow frames on the Switch (which TJS / layer operations).
3. Go through more games with input scripts on PC (any KAG game must work unmodified); fix
   engine differences generically (like `TJSClassVarKeepsProperty`, KAG restore), never per game.
4. `.tpm` decryptor support (own x86 interpreter + PE loader), so no `xp3filter.tjs` is needed.
5. Real extrans transitions; more plugins as games need them (layerExDraw, layerExImage, ...).
6. Video: sync to the audio clock; check decode speed on the Switch.
7. Overlay folder and per-game profiles (M2/M3).

Rules from the user: test on the Switch before merging; everything must work for any Kirikiri
game, not just FSN; never commit game files or keys; game folders are never modified.
